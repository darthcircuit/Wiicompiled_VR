// the draw data's aspect. On a menu frame the screen is the quad the eye image is shown on; in an
// immersive race it is the 2D layer's screen (aurora_set_stereo_hud_screen's width and distance,
// whether or not the 2D layer is placed on it).

// The draw data belongs to the host's context and is rendered with Aurora's ImGui backend, so its
// texture ids must be views that backend can bind (aurora_imgui_add_texture). Call this from the

// done with that frame (aurora_wait_for_frame_worker). Null hides the panel.

// consumes. A handle that is never presented is freed with aurora_imgui_host_frame_release().
