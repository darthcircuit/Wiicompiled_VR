/**
 * The game: the immersive activity that runs the native runtime and the player's
 * own compiled game. The app opens on [org.wiicompiled.quest.launcher.LauncherActivity],
 * whose Play button starts this one.
 *
 * SDLActivity owns the surface, the Java-side event pump and the JNI plumbing
 * the OpenXR loader needs (the runtime fetches the JavaVM and this activity
 * through SDL_GetAndroidJNIEnv/SDL_GetAndroidActivity). What this subclass
 * adds is everything the native runtime cannot discover on its own:
 *
 *  - the data directory the player fills with the extracted disc
 *    (Android/data/<package>/files/WiiCompiledOpenXRVR/DATA) and where
 *    Config.toml, saves and logs live ([GameStorage]);
 *  - the bundled read-only runtime resources, unpacked from the APK once.
 *
 * The paths are handed over through the environment before SDLActivity's own
 * onCreate loads the native libraries, because the runtime resolves them from
 * static initialisers where SDL's JNI helpers are not yet usable.
 *
 * This activity lives in its own `:game` process, and that process ends with
 * it. Neither SDL nor the runtime can start a second time in one process:
 * SDLActivity calls System.exit on a re-created activity once SDL_main has run,
 * and guest memory, fibers and the OpenXR device are process-wide. A fresh
 * process per session also keeps the launcher alive when the game exits.
